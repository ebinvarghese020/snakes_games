# Snake Game 

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and avoid collisions with walls and its own body. This implementation is built using Python classes and the Turtle module.

## Features

- **Arrow Key Controls**: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) to navigate the snake's movement.
- **Random Food Generation**: Food appears randomly on the screen for the snake to consume and grow longer.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score as they eat food. The score increases with each consumed food.
- **Game Over and Restart**: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body. Players can restart the game.

  ## How to Play

- Launch the game.
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) to control the snake's movement.
- The snake starts with a small length and appears on the screen.
- The objective is to eat the food that randomly appears on the screen.
- Eating food increases the snake's length and score.
- Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
- If the snake hits a wall or itself, the game ends.
- Restart the game to challenge yourself and achieve a higher score.

  ## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in the Python standard library)

- Getting Started

- Clone the repository or download the source code files.
- Navigate to the project directory in the terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to start the game: """ python snake.py """

## Acknowledgments

This Snake game was developed using Python classes and the Turtle module, inspired by the classic arcade game. Special thanks to the Python community and the creators of the Turtle module for providing a powerful and user-friendly framework for game development.
