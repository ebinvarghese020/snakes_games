This is a Python implementation of the classic Snake Game, inspired by the version found on Nokia mobile phones. The game is built using Python classes and the Turtle graphics library.

In this game, players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer with each meal. The objective is to guide the snake to collect as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or its own body.

The game features a simple and intuitive interface. Players use the arrow keys to navigate the snake, and the game speeds up as the snake grows, increasing the challenge. The score is displayed on the screen, allowing players to track their progress and compete for higher scores.

The Snake Game demonstrates the power of Python classes and the Turtle graphics library in creating interactive and enjoyable gameplay experiences. It serves as a great example for beginners learning Python or anyone interested in exploring game development.

To play the game, simply run the Python script and control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Have fun and enjoy the nostalgic experience of playing the Snake Game on your computer!
